This is a directory with config files for everyday use ;)
Most of them should be placed in the home directory,
but there are exceptions.

Example:
.desktop - service menu actions for Konqueror / Dolphin 
(KDE 4)

These need to go to ~/.kde/share/kde4/services
(or maybe  ~/.kde/share/kde4/services/ServiceMenus,
 which can be created if it doesn't exist).
