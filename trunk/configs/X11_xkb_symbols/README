1.
Copy the file(s), except this one, to (probably):
/usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/

2.
Then (probably) delete the .xkm files in:
/var/lib/xkb/

and reboot.

3.
It will become possible to:
setxkbmap -layout 'pl(colemak)'
(and confuse keyboard layout switcher...)

4.
Integrate with keyboard layout switcher:
overwrite files in:
/usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/
with files from rules/ subdirectory (base.lst/.xml, evdev.lst/.xml)

5. Open keyboard layout switcher, register your new keyboard layout...
